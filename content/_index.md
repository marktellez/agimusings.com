AGI is about to change the world in ways we are just not prepared for. Even the best and brightest computer and neuroscientists disagree on how we can give birth to Artificial General Intelligence without dooming the Human race.

This website contains breakdowns of these arguments, glossaries and articles explaining the strange concepts you need to understand to navigate the fourth industrial revolution (4IR). It's my goal as an AI researcher to democratize these concepts into words that people can understand without having an 8 years degree in AI.
